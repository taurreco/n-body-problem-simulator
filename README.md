# N-Body Problem Simulator
A basic representation of how Newton's law of universal gravitation affects the relationship between many bodies of mass.

Controls:
- Left mouse click to add a new body
- Left mouse click and drag to add a new body with starting velocity
- Spacebar or 'p' to pause the simulation
- Up/down arrow to increment and decrement the radius size

You can add new bodies to the simulation while paused.  When paused, new bodies added will show their starting velocity.
There is the option to change the radius size between 0 and 400, but you must click the 'Set Radius' button for it to apply to future bodies.
You also have the option to trace the paths of the bodies with/without color.  These paths can be tapered or permanently drawn to the screen.
The paths can be tapered from anywhere in between 0 and 100 pixels.
The net force exerted on these bodies can also be displayed as a line in the direction of pull with its length in proportion to the magnitude.
